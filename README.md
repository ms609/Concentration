# Concentration

Do you ever find yourself struggling to concentrate?

Perhaps it's not surprising if you do: someone is being paid, right now, 
to divert your attention from the task that you are trying to conduct.

The good news is that concentration is a learnable skill: with the right
approach, you can shut out distraction and train yourself to focus.

This page outlines approaches that have helped me to master the skill of concentration.
They might not all work for you, but why not give them a try: hopefully they will
give you ideas of how you can work more effectively -- buying you time to rest without guilt.


## Intentional time management

To take control of your money, it's necessary to understand where your money is going.
The same goes for time.

I use [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com) to track each minute of my working day. 
Toggl is a simple program that lets you mark with a click each time you switch from
one task to another.

When I decide that a task merits an hour of my time, it's now easy to see when 
I've used this time -- allowing me to stop when I've used up my time without 
feeling guilty.  And when I've worked my hours for the week, I can go home and 
enjoy a restful weekend without feeling any need to 'keep up' with work.

A meritious and unexpeected side effect came as a result of stopping the timer
each time I stopped to check the news or my e-mail.  These interruptions
were more frequent than I would have estimated -- and what is more, occurred
subconsciously.  Having to decide to stop the timer let me stop and ask whether
I really needed to check the news.  The answer to this question usually turns out to be
either "No: you need a proper break, go and make a cup of tea", or "No: you are
procrastinating because the next task is difficult. You can do it!".
