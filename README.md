# Concentration

Do you ever find yourself struggling to concentrate?

Concentration is a learnable skill: with the right approach, 
you can shut out distraction and train yourself to focus.

This page outlines approaches that have helped me to develop the skill of concentration.
Hopefully they will help you to reflect on how you can work more effectively.


## Intentional time management

To take control of your finances, it's necessary to understand where you spend your money.
The same goes for time.

I use [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com) to track each minute of my working day. 
Toggl is a simple program that lets you mark with a click when you switch from
one task to another.

This lets me decide that a task merits X hours of my time, and to stop when 
I've used the allotted hours without feeling guilty.  
And when I've worked my hours for the week, I can go home and 
enjoy a restful weekend without feeling any need to 'keep up' with work.

As a meritious and unexpected side effect of having to stop the timer
each time I checked the news or my e-mail, I noticed that such interruptions
were more frequent than I would have estimated -- and what is more, occurred
subconsciously.  Having to decide to stop the timer allowed me to evaluate whether
I really needed to check the news.  The answer to this question usually turns out to be
either "No: you need a proper break, go and make a cup of tea", or "No: you are
procrastinating because the next task is difficult. You can do it!".

## Interruptions

Internet firms want to sell your attention to advertisers. 

I half remember an experiment performed on pigeons who had been conditioned to
peck at a red light to obtain food.  Like Pavlov's dogs drooling at a bell,
the light, once seen, triggered an irresistable peck reflex.
When the experimenters replaced the food with a painful electric shock,
the pigeons couldn't overcome their peck reflex.
What they could do -- if they were quick -- was turn around so they could
no longer see the red light.  With the light out of sight, their urge to peck
waned, and they saved themselves a shock.

I recently went to a website that I often visit for information.
On this occasion, there was a little red dot next to one of the icons in the toolbar.

![Stack overflow buttons](https://github.com/ms609/concentration/raw/master/img/RedDot.png "A little red dot")

I'd never noticed the icon before -- perhaps it had been there for years.  But now it
had a red dot next to it.  Obviously, I stopped looking for the information that I needed,
and clicked on the red dot.  A menu popped up.

![Stack overflow review queue](https://github.com/ms609/concentration/raw/master/img/RedDotMenu.png "More red dots!")

This menu contained more red dots!

I had no idea what "First Posts" or "Triage" meant.

Certainly they were not going to help me to get the information I needed.

But they were accompanied by red dots.
My attention was needed!  How could I possibly refuse?

### Purpose in browsing

When I am concentrating well, I always have a specific reason for visiting a website.
Once I've accomplished by purpose, I close the site.

However, websites are often designed to divert you from the task that you intended 
to perform.  Sometimes -- as above -- this leads to getting sidetracked from 
a task that you were concentrating on.

I suspect that it is helpful to adhere to a 'purposeful browsing' philosophy even
when not prioritizing concentration.  Sometimes this means finding ways to avoid
the addiction-forming elements of websites.  Rather than encounter Facebook's 
'news feed', I always navigate directly to the messages page.  
Usually my reason for visiting Facebook is to read messages; 
on the occasion that I am enthusiastic to see what
photographs a friend has recently taken of their dinner, I can search for their 
profile from the message page without being bombarded with opportunities to
peck at red dots.


### uBlock

To complement this approach,
I use a browser extension called [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/)
to block website components that target my attention.  
The plugin will silently remove selected elements from webpages,
as if they never existed.

![uBlock](https://github.com/ms609/concentration/raw/master/img/uBlock.png "uBlock interface")

A little zapping later, I have never been bothered by this particular red dot again:

![uBlock red dot zapper](https://github.com/ms609/concentration/raw/master/img/NoMoreRedDot.png "No more red dots!")

![uBlock red dot zapped](https://github.com/ms609/concentration/raw/master/img/WithoutRedDot.png "It's gone.")

As a convenient side effect, uBlock also removes intrusive advertising from web pages.


### E-mail

Perhaps you are thinking of a website where you _need_ to be notified the second that 
something happens?  An example that might spring to mind is your e-mail inbox.

By default, my e-mail provider marks unread messages in bold,
highlights their background, lists the number of unread messages in the page title,
and will even offer to flash up an intrusive notification each time a message arrives.

This product design is based on the premise that every e-mail that arrives is more 
important than what you are currently doing.  If you wish to concentrate, then this
state of regular interruption is undesirable: a different approach is necessary.

Rather than seeing e-mail as a constant chatter, always clamouring for my attention, 
I set aside blocks of time -- one in the morning, one in the afternoon -- for responding
to e-mail.  I don't open my e-mail client except at these times.  (Browser extensions
make it possible to deny yourself access to certain sites: self-control is a finite resource.)

But what if this means I miss an urgent e-mail, your subconscious may yell.  
I found it helpful to make a list of people who may require a response within three 
hours, and to tell these people to telephone me when they had an urgent enquiry.

The instinct that e-mail requires immediate action is deeply rooted.  I have tried
a few experiments to train out this feeling of stressful hurry.  One approach that
helped was to configure my e-mail client to delay the arrival of e-mails in my 
inbox by half an hour.  Another is to have a default policy of waiting 24 hours 
before replying to an e-mail: the occasional exception is necessary, but I found
instructive the number of 'urgent' messages that, the next morning, had resolved
themselves and required no reply.  This approach also made my e-mail workflow more
efficient: instead of exchanging a dozen 'urgent' messages to arrange a meeting,
I now write "Can we meet in room 7 at 14:30 on Tuesday? If not, could you suggest 
two or three times on Tues afternoon or Weds morning that would work for you?"

The other way that that e-mail exerts a hold on concentration is by giving a feeling 
of work undone.  Most e-mail clients distinguish between "read" and "unread" e-mails.
I have configured mine to mark all incoming e-mails as "read".  For me, the important
distinction is whether an e-mail needs action from me, or not.  
When I log on to my e-mails, I first triage every message in my inbox.  If it doesn't
require action, I archive it immediately -- I can always search for it later if it
contains important information.  If I can't, or choose not to, act on the message 
immediately, I decide when I will next need to take action -- perhaps to chase up 
a response, or to forward information that I don't yet have -- and use the 'snooze'
function (implemented in Gmail and Outlook) to remove the message from my inbox 
until the appointed time.  This done, I can act on any remaining e-mails, leaving
an empty inbox.  Any I really can't stomach get snoozed until later.  
This way, when I log off, I no longer have that nagging feeling that my 
e-mails require further attention.
